# shoppool

This project was designed with the help of the following tutorial created by Edwin Diaz: https://www.udemy.com/course/php-for-beginners-how-to-build-an-ecommerce-store/.

In this tutorial, I learned how to use PHP, MySQL, HTML/CSS, and more to design my application. I customized the application which I made using the tutorial, and this app now serves to help farmers sell their products online.

I also deployed this web application on heroku. The following link will take you to this website: http://shoppool.herokuapp.com/public/.
